A dice game!
-Work in progress

## Rules:
On a player's turn, they first **roll** all 6 dice. A player may roll up to 2 additional times only if they **hold** points on the previous roll (scoring table below). If a player does not score on a roll, they lose all the points accumulated during their entire turn. Using all 6 dice to score points allows the player to roll all 6 once again. The game ends when a player scores **10,000 points**.

#### Scoring
Rolling a 1 or a 5 are the two easiest ways to get points.
 - 5 is worth 50 points
 - 1 is worth 100 points
Next, rolling 3-of-a-kind of any numbers are worth extra points
 - Three 1's are worth 1000
 - Three of everything else are worth 100 times the number
4-of-a-kind and onwards are worth double their predicesor
 - Four 3's are worth 600 (300 * 2)
 - Six 1's are worth 8000 (1000 * 2 * 2 * 2)
5 long and 6 long straights also give points
 - 1 2 3 4 5 or 2 3 4 5 6 are both worth 500
 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 is worth 1000
Lastly, having 3 pairs of numbers gives points
 - 2 2 4 4 6 6 (or any combination of pairs) is worth 1000
Points are cummulative over a turn and may be lost if the player rolls dead (anything not scoring).
It is possible to roll dead on the first roll by getting some combination of the 4 dead numbers, 2 3 4 6 (ex 2 2 3 4 6 6).
