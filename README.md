A dice game!
-Work in progress

## Rules:
On a player's turn, they first **roll** all 6 dice. A player may roll up to 2 additional times only if they **hold** points on the previous roll (scoring table below). If a player does not score on a roll, they lose all the points accumulated during their entire turn. Using all 6 dice to score points allows the player to roll all 6 once again. The game ends when a player scores **10,000 points**.

Rolling a 1 or a 5 are the easiest ways to get points.
 - 5 is worth 50 points
 - 1 is worth 100 points
